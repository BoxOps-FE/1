             "One way to visualize these circles in the sky is to imagine Earth as a transparent sphere with the terrestrial coordinates (latitude and longitude) painted on it with dark paint. Imagine the celestial sphere around us as a giant ball, painted white on the inside. Then imagine yourself at the center of Earth, with a bright light bulb in the middle, looking out through its transparent surface to the sky. The terrestrial poles, equator, and meridians will be projected as dark shadows on the celestial sphere, giving us the system of coordinates in the sky."

             "According to the globe Polaris drops in angle as you move south because of earth curve getting in the way. Major problem is when you rise in altitude, say in an airplane 6 miles up you get the SAME ANGLE after removing lots of earth curve that is supposed to be blocking. Say you're at 45° latitude, so you have a 45° elevation angle to Polaris. Globe claims that's because earth curve is blocking 45° of it. That falls apart completely when you can go six miles up in a <b>plane</b> and get the same 45° elevation angle. Since when does going higher not let you see farther on a globe. See the problem?"

            Harvard, "Altitude–azimuth coordinates. The horizon system is the most intuitive when we first begin to discuss the positions of stars. Here, the fundamental <b>plane</b> is the <b>plane</b> of the observer's ideal horizon. In the horizon system, altitude is the first coordinate we need to uniquely identify any point on the sky. Altitude is the angle that the observer would measure from the horizon to an object in the sky. Determining the second coordinate requires selecting a zero point direction along the horizon, and for that we choose the north point. The azimuth is defined as the angle measured in the <b>plane</b> of the horizon from the north point to the point at which the arc from the zenith through the object crosses the horizon."

            LibreTexts, "Specifically, map projections are mathematical formulas used to translate latitude and longitude on the earth's surface to x and y coordinates on a <b>plane</b>. Since there is an infinite number of ways this translation can be performed, there is an infinite number of map projections..There are trade-offs made concerning distortion on every map. There are no fixed rules as to which distortions are more preferred over others. Therefore, the selection of map projection depends on the map's purpose."

            New Mexico State University, "As shown above, an observer has the impression of being on a flat plane and at the center of a vast hemisphere across which the celestial bodies move. On all sides, the plane stretches out to meet the base of this celestial hemisphere at the horizon. The point directly overhead the observer (as defined by a line passing through the center of the Earth and perpendicular to the horizon) is known as the zenith."
